Had my 'it' and 'subject' question answered on StackOverflow

Finally found out why RSpec wasn't recognising my get method (needed to initialise rspec)

Still getting error, searching for more solutions

Found the issue by reading rspec documentation, needed to initialise the rails rspec (not just the ruby rpsec)
